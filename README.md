## üìñ Project: LiteBot ‚Äì Article Research Tool

LiteBot is a Streamlit-based research assistant that allows users to input article URLs, automatically fetch content, split it into chunks, create embeddings with HuggingFace models, and store them in ChromaDB.
Users can then ask questions about the content, and LiteBot will generate answers with relevant sources using LangChain + ChatGroq.

Splits long texts into meaningful chunks for embeddings.

Stores embeddings persistently with Chroma Vector Store.

Uses HuggingFace Sentence Transformers for embeddings.

Provides accurate Q&A with sources using LangChain + Groq LLM.

Built with Streamlit for an interactive UI.
